Thoughts:

Want to incorporate a data lake with raw data and a data warehouse with processed data

Data Lake:
- All data in a raw, unstructured form
- Data can be for immediate or future use
- Google cloud platform ?

Data Warehouse:
- Contains structured data that has been cleaned and processed
- Some Postgres or MySQL DB ?

Sensors:

Slack Notifications:
- On failure of any tasks
