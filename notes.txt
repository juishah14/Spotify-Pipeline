Thoughts:

Want to incorporate a data lake with raw data and a data warehouse with processed data

Data Lake: Google Cloud Storage (can alternatively use S3, Azure Data Lake, or Databricks)
- All data in a raw, unstructured form
- Data can be for immediate or future use

Data Warehouse: Mongo DB (can alternatively use Postgres or MySQL)
- Contains structured data that has been cleaned and processed

Slack Operator:
- Sends message upon failure of any tasks


To Do:
- Look into data lakes and warehouses
- Look into what data to get from Spotify


generate auth headers -> (collect album data, collect music type info, etc) -> send raw data to data lake ->
(aggregate_data1, aggregate_data2) -> send processed data to data warehouse

maybe separate dag that runs less frequently that generates some type of summary or report
